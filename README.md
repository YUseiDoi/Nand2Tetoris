# Nand2Tetoris
## Progress
* day1(2022/02/12):  created And, Not, Or gate from Nand
* day2(2022/02/13):  craeted Xor, Mux, DMux, And16, Not16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way
* day3(2022/02/15):  created Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way, and finished Chapter 1
* day4(2022/02/16):  read through Chapter 2 and got started with coding
* day5(2022/02/17):  coded but no progress
* day6(2022/03/03):  This is the first time for about 2 weeks because of TOEIC. created HalfAdder, FulAdder, Add16
                     I found that it's important to follow the textbook carefully.
* day7(2022/03/05):  created Inc16 and ALU halfway
* day8(2022/03/09):  tried to create ALU but it's still halfway. I found that true and false can be used in HDL.
* day9(2022/03/23):  created ALU and the Chapter-2 has done. then next, go to the Chapter-3 and created Bit, Register, RAM8
* day10(2022/03/26): created RAM64, PC, RAM512, RAM4K, RAM16K, and finished Chapter-3. then moved to Chapter-4.
* day11(2022/03/30): created Mult.
* day12(2022/04/12): created Fill, and the Chapter-4 has done.
* day13(2022/05/04): read the Chapter-5 and summarized it in Notion, and started creating Memory first of all.
* day14(2022/05/05): created Memory, but it's still halfway.
* day15(2022/05/06): realised that I misunderstood the index of array in HDL..
